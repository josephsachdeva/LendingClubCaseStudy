## General Information
- The project is a data science project that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

- The dataset of previous loans, which includes whether the customer has "Fully Paid" the loan amount or a defaulter ("Charged Off").

## Conclusions
- Home Ownership is one of the major thing to look out when giving out the loans. The persons who don’t own their own house are the most defaulters.
- Customers having Grade E  should be avoided giving loans, as there are almost 100% chance that the loan will be defaulted.
- The verifier should be cautious for people who have Grade D
- A person is most likely to be a defaulter when, the Loan Amount is ranging from: 5K to 14K and the Interest Rate is in the range of 10 to 16.
- The likelihood of a person to be a defaulter increases when the DTI Ratio starts from 10 and decreases when the DTI Ratio ends at 25.
- The persons who have the following purposes to get the loan are likely to return the loan amount:
- - Car
- - Wedding
- - Medical
- - House
